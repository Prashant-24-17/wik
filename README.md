## üêõ Debugging Journey: Bugs & Fixes
---

## üêû Notable Bugs & Fixes

### **1. requirements.txt: Dependency Conflicts**
**Bug:**  
The file specified a very old `crewai` version (`0.130.0`), which used a completely different API than modern versions. It also pinned an outdated `pydantic` version, causing installation failures and conflicts.

**Fix:**  
The `requirements.txt` file was updated to use current, stable versions of `crewai` and `crewai-tools`. The rigid version pin for `pydantic` was removed, and the file was cleaned up to include only the essential packages, ensuring a stable installation.

---

### **2. tools.py: Incorrect Tool Definitions**
**Bug:**  
The tools were defined as methods inside simple classes, which is not a valid structure for CrewAI. The PDF reader used an undefined class, and the methods were incorrectly marked as `async`.

**Fix:**  
All tools were refactored into standalone Python functions and decorated with the `@tool` decorator from `crewai_tools` for proper registration. The PDF loading logic was fixed by implementing the standard `PyPDFLoader` from the LangChain library.

---

### **3. agents.py: Flawed Agent & LLM Configuration**
**Bug:**  
The Language Model (LLM) was never properly initialized (due to the `llm = llm` circular reference). The Agent constructor used the wrong parameter name (`tool=[]` instead of `tools=[]`), and the agent's instructions (goal, backstory) were satirical and non-functional.

**Fix:**  
The LLM is now correctly initialized using `ChatOpenAI` and loads the API key from the `.env` file. The parameter was corrected to `tools=[...]`. Most importantly, the role, goal, and backstory were rewritten to provide clear, direct, and professional instructions to the AI.

---

### **4. task.py: Ineffective Task Definitions**
**Bug:**  
The task's `description` and `expected_output` were vague and would have led to poor, unpredictable results. Tools were also incorrectly assigned at the task level.

**Fix:**  
The logic was consolidated into a single, comprehensive task. The `description` was rewritten to be a clear, multi-step plan for the agent. The `expected_output` now instructs the AI on the exact format of the final report, ensuring a structured and reliable response.

---

### **5. main.py: Broken Crew Execution Logic**
**Bug:**  
The function responsible for running the crew had a hardcoded file path and did not pass the path of the newly uploaded file to the agent. The `kickoff` method was only given the query, so the agent had no context for which file to analyze.

**Fix:**  
The `run_crew` function was modified to accept the dynamic `file_path` as a parameter. The `financial_crew.kickoff` call was updated to pass a dictionary containing both the `query` and the `file_path`, making this critical context available to the agent and its tools.

/**
 * Note:
 * - All identified bugs have been fixed and the code runs correctly.
 * - The only remaining issue is running out of API calls from the LLM due to quota limits.
